/**
 * Base interface for DataLift application modules.
 * <p>
 * Modules are JAX-RS root resources, the class shall be annotated with
 * the JAX-RS {@link javax.ws.rs.Path @Path} annotation. A single
 * instance of the class is created and {@link LifeCycle initialized}
 * to be handed over to the underlying JAX-RS implementation.</p>
 * <p>
 * Modules can be packaged as a JAR file or a directory (a deployment
 * unit) and are loaded using the
 * {@link java.util.ServiceLoader Java service provider} mechanism.</p>
 * <p>
 * Each deployment unit shall include a UTF-8 encoded
 * <i>provider-configuration file</i> named
 * <code>META-INF/services/org.datalift.fwk.Module</code> that contains
 * a list of fully-qualified implementation class names.</p>
 * <p>
 * If the module is packaged as a directory, the following
 * sub-directories and files are considered:</p>
 * <dl>
 *  <dt><code>/classes</code></dt>
 *  <dd>The default directory for module classes</dd>
 *  <dt><code>/*.jar</code></dt>
 *  <dd>JAR files containing the module classes, if no
 *      <code>/classes</code> directory is present</dd>
 *  <dt><code>/lib/**&#47;*.jar</code></dt>
 *  <dd>JAR files in the <code>/lib</code> directory tree containing
 *      the module classes and/or third-party libraries</dd>
 * </dl>
 * <p>deployment units can include static resources. Resources in the
 * <code>/public</code> directory are accessible externally over HTTP as
 * "<code>&lt;base URL&gt;/&lt;module name&gt;/&lt;resource name&gt;</code>"
 * (the <code>/public</code> part is removed from the URL). Other
 * static resources can only be accessed internally to the server
 * (e.g. Velocity templates).</p>
 * <p>
 * The DataLift application loads each deployment unit in dedicated a
 * class loader. Hence, modules from the same deployment unit can access
 * each others directly (i.e. through Java methods calls) but cannot
 * invoke methods on modules from other deployment units except through
 * framework-defined interfaces such as the
 * {@link org.datalift.fwk.sparql.SparqlEndpoint SPARQL endpoint}
 * interface.</p>
