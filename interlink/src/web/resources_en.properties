interlink.button                 = Interlinking with Silk
interlink.description            = Silk is a linked data tool which helps discover relationship between objects from different datasets. Data publishers can use Silk to create RDF links from their data sources to other data sources on the Web of data. 
interlink.file.title             = Interlinking from an existing configuration
interlink.file.description       = To use an external configuration, its XML configuration file has to be imported before telling which interlinking <span title="&lt;Interlink id='id'&gt;">identifier</span> to use.
interlink.file.warning           = To be available from Datalift, the interlinking submitted to Datalift must at least contain the following output:
interlink.script.title           = Interlinking script builder
interlink.script.description     = This interlinking module is an interface to create and execute Silk configuration scripts: in order to work, Silk needs to be configured by pointing out what data to use, how to explore it, how to match datasets, and how to create new links between them.
interlink.silk.description       = The Silk configuraiton scripts built with this interface are limited to creating owl:sameAs links in a new Datalift source, however, Silk is not limited to this use case and it remains possible to execute a script created outside of Datalift on Datalift's datasets. It is also possible to export a script created with this interface for later use.
