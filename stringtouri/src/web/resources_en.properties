stringtouri.description = StringToURI is an interconnection module which replaces literal values by the URIs to the entities which they describe. For example, for a given triple &lt;http://example.org/person/Bob&gt; ex:livesIn "France", we might want to replace the string value "France" by a URI to the RDF entity of class Country corresponding to the "France" value. At the end of the StringToURI interconnection process, we'll obtain : &lt;http://example.org/person/Bob&gt; ex:livesIn &lt;http://example.org/countries/France&gt;.
