This a native application wrapper for packaging and running DataLift as a standalone single-user application.
This wrapper supports building a native application for the following op√©rating systems:
 - Mac OS X 10.6 (Leopard) or higher, Java 6+ required
 - Windows, Java 6+ required
 - Linux

When run, the wrapper first starts a standalone DataLift server and then opens a new tab or window in the user's default Web browser, pointing it at the SPARQL endpoint of the DataLift server.

Please note that the standalone DataLift server is not a general purpose DataLift installation. In particular, it performs no user authentication, expecting that only the user that started the application will access it.


1. Mac OS X
-----------
The DataLift application initializes a DataLift runtime environment for the user the first time it is started.

It stores data in the following locations (<user home> denoting the user home directory):
 - <user home>/Library/Application Support/DataLift: the persistent DataLift data, as follows:
    - conf:		the DataLift (editable) configuration
    - modules:		supplementary user-specific DataLift modules
    - repositories: 	OpenRDF Sesame RDF databases (projects, lifted data...)
    - storage:		Uploaded data source files
 - <user home>/Library/Caches/DataLift: temporary files, data caches...
 - <user home>/Library/Logs/DataLift: log files

Users can install modules in addition to the default ones (project and SPARQL endpoint) by dropping the module JARs into <user home>/Library/Application Support/DataLift/modules.

2. Windows
----------
The DataLift application initializes a DataLift runtime environment for the user the first time it is started.

It stores data in the following locations (<user home> denoting the user home directory):
 - <user home>/AppData/Roaming/DataLift : 
 the persistent DataLift data, as follows:
    - conf:		the DataLift (editable) configuration
	- logs : 	log files
    - modules:		supplementary user-specific DataLift modules
    - repositories: 	OpenRDF Sesame RDF databases (projects, lifted data...)
    - storage:		Uploaded data source files
	- temp : 	temporary files
	- work : 	caches files

Please note that the AppData folder his originaly hidden. 

Users can install modules in addition to the default ones (project and SPARQL endpoint) by dropping the module JARs into <user home>/AppData/Roaming/DataLift/modules.
